        <h5>Who is Sherlock Holmes?</h5>
        <p>He is the fictional but brilliant detective created by Arthur Conan Doyle in 1887, created for the novel A Study In Scarlet, published in Beeton’s Christmas Annual.
        Sherlock Holmes has essentially an obsessive personality. He works compulsively on all his cases and his deductive powers are phenomenal. He can get engulfed in periods 
        of depression between cases and is known to take cocaine when he cannot stand the lack of activity. He has an in depth knowledge of music and plays on a Stradivarius that 
        he bought for a song in Tottenham. He is also known to run chemistry experiments in his spare time to the dismay of both Dr. Watson and his landlady Mrs. Hudson.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h5>Who is he inspired of?</h5>
        <p>It is commonly agreed that the character traits of Sherlock Holmes were inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, one of the teachers at the medical school of Edinburgh University. In 
        particular, Holmes’s uncanny ability to gather evidence based upon his honed skills of observation and deductive reasoning paralleled Bell’s method of diagnosing a patient’s disease. 
        This is how Conan Doyle described Dr Bell: A “thin wiry, dark” man, “with a high-nosed acute face, penetrating grey eyes, and angular shoulders.” Dr. Bell “would sit in his receiving 
        room with a face like a Red Indian, and diagnose the people as they came in, before they even opened their mouths.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h5>Who is his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?</h5>
        <p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short-stories featuring his creation. Almost all were narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson, with the 
        exception of two narrated by Holmes himself and two more written in the third person. The stories first appeared in magazine serialization, notably in The Strand Magazine, over a period 
        of forty years. This was a common form of publication at the time: Charles Dickens' works were issued in a similar fashion. The stories cover a period from around 1878 up to 1903, with a final 
        case in 1914. They are read as much for their characterization and the stylised late-Victorian era in which they take place as for the mysteries themselves.</p>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h6>Life with Watson</h6>
        <p>Financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr. Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London. Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Holmes works as a detective 
        for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years. Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson's point of view, as summaries of the detective's most 
        interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the "science" of his craft.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h6>Practice</h6>
        <p>Holmes's clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select 
        professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raises Holmes's profile, 
        and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police that, Watson writes, by 1887 "Europe was ringing with his name" and 
        by 1895 Holmes has "an immense practice". Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h6>The Great Hiatus</h6>
        <p>The first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty in "The Final Problem" 
            , as Conan Doyle felt that "my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel."However, the reaction of the public surprised Doyle very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished 
            letters to The Strand Magazine, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people canceled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest. Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and 
            one lady even began her letter with "You brute". </p>
