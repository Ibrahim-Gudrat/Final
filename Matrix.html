        <h5>General Info</h5>
        <p>The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis, and produced by Joel Silver. Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, 
            Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and as the first installment in the Matrix franchise, it depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly 
            trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer 
            programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he "is drawn into a rebellion against the machines" along with other people who have been 
            freed from the Matrix.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h5>Development</h5>
        <p>In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins to Warner Bros. Pictures. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, 
            read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, Bound and The Matrix, in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, Bound, then became 
            a critical success. Using this momentum, they later asked to direct The Matrix. In 1996 the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo to Will Smith. Smith explained on his YouTube channel 
            that the idea was for him to be Neo, while Morpheus was to be played by Val Kilmer. He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead 
            film Wild Wild West.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h5>Pre-production</h5>
        <p>The cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal 
            cast and crew. In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves read Simulacra and Simulation, Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, 
            and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script, and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented 
            that she had difficulty with this process. The directors had long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema, so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes.</p>

        <h6>Filming</h6>
        <p>All but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, and in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included in order to maintain the impression of a generic American city. 
            The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center. Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days.
            Due to Reeves' neck injury, some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much 
            physical exertion, such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room, or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. Locations for these scenes included 
            Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, half-way between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed 
            extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. </p>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h6>Sound effects and music</h6>
        <p>Dane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and 
            recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together. The film's score was composed by Don Davis. 
            He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror 
            of Trinity's motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis 
            focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas.</p>

    <div class="box col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h6>Production design</h6>
        <p>In the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, 
            which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals. In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, 
            who is from Japan, and added, "I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes". "The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on 
            early monochrome computer monitors". Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the 
            general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall.</p>
